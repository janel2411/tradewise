        <h1>Lesson 1: What is Forex?</h1>
        <p>Forex, short for "foreign exchange," is the <strong>global financial market for trading currencies</strong>. It's like when you exchange money at an airport before an international trip—every time you change one currency to another, you participate in the forex market.</p>

        <p>Imagine this: You're traveling from the U.S. to Japan with $10, and upon arrival, you find out your dollars are worth 100 yen each. Excitedly, you exchange all your money. In forex trading terms, you've just sold dollars and bought yen. When you return, you notice the exchange rates have changed. These fluctuations are what allow traders to potentially make a profit.</p>

        <p>The forex market, often referred to as FX, is the <strong>largest financial market globally</strong>, dwarfing others with a daily trading volume of approximately USD $6.6 trillion. To put it in perspective, it's <strong>over 200 times larger</strong> than the New York Stock Exchange, which trades about USD $200 billion daily. While the NYSE might seem significant, it pales in comparison to the enormity of the forex market.</p>

        <p>However, it's important to note that the astonishing USD $6.6 trillion includes all types of forex trading. For individual retail traders like us, the segment we're interested in is much smaller—estimated at about 3-5% of the total market, or around $200-300 billion per day.</p>

        <p>Despite its vast size, the forex market operates around the clock, 24 hours a day, six days a week. It starts each week in Auckland/Wellington, progresses through major financial centers like Sydney, Singapore, Tokyo, London, and ends the week in New York, before starting all over again the following week.</p>

        <p>In essence, forex is a dynamic, ever-present market that offers <strong>continuous opportunities</strong> for those looking to trade currencies, making use of <strong>leverage and changes in exchange rates</strong> to potentially make profit.</p>
